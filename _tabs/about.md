## About Me

I am a Robotics Engineer specializing in autonomous quadcopters for educational applications at [Duckietown](https://duckietown.com/).

I earned my BSc in Aerospace Engineering from the Polytechnic of Turin, where I developed my thesis under the supervision of Prof. Giuliana Mattiazzo. My work focused on designing telemetry systems for high-performance sailing boats used in competitive racing as part of the Polito Sailing Team.

I then pursued an MSc in Space Engineering at the Polytechnic of Milan, where I conducted my master’s thesis on reinforcement learning for planetary landing under the supervision of Prof. Michèle Lavagna during my internship at Deimos Space.

Additionally, I explored multi-agent SLAM and the adaptation of visuomotor policies during a research internship at the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, working under the guidance of Prof. Matthew Walter.

## Research Interests

I am passionate about advancing robotics by integrating machine learning and control theory for real-world applications. My current interests include:

- Autonomous systems for aerial robotics.
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive control.
- Multi-agent SLAM and navigation in dynamic environments.

    <h3>Adaptive MRAC Controller for Quadcopter</h3>
    <p>This project aimed to achieve trajectory tracking for a quadrotor using adaptive control laws by developing a baseline PI controller with LQR methodology, incorporating adaptive augmentation for handling uncertain aerodynamic effects, and introducing robust modifications to maintain performance under disturbances.</p>
